                Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add onion and fry until soft, 
                3 to 4 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in curry paste and fry until fragrant,
                1 minute more, stirring once or twice. Add the tomato mixture and chicken to the pan and mix together.
                 Season with salt and pepper. Remove pan from heat.

                 Return pan to the heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, 
                about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until thickened, about 15 minutes more.
                 Sprinkle with cilantro and serve immediately.
